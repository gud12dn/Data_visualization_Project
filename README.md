# Data_visualization_Project

This repository contains a collection of data visualization projects and assignments

Each project demonstrates the application of various data visualization techniques using R and ggplot2, covering topics such as:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual encoding
- Geospatial visualization
- Advanced faceting and interaction
- Effective communication of data insights

## Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Visualization 1
- Basic principles of effective visualization
- Application of visual encoding choices (color, size, shape, position)
- Critique and redesign of sample visualizations

### 2️⃣ Visualization 2
- Practical visualization exercises with real-world datasets
- Techniques for enhancing clarity and interpretability
- Creation of comparative and multivariate visualizations

### 3️⃣ Visualization 3
- Geospatial data visualization (e.g., mapping and spatial analysis)
- Application of vector and raster data concepts
- Use of R libraries such as `sf`, `tmap`, and `ggplot2`

### 4️⃣ Visualization 4
- Advanced visualization with interactivity
- Dashboard-style reporting of multi-dimensional data
- Communication of complex findings to non-expert audiences

## Technologies Used
- **R** and **RStudio**
- **ggplot2** ecosystem
- **sf**, **tmap**, **dplyr**, **tidyr**
- HTML export via `rmarkdown` and `knitr`

## Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I have developed skills in:
- Designing clear, effective, and aesthetically pleasing visualizations
- Using visualization to uncover patterns and communicate findings
- Applying best practices in encoding, layout, and interactivity
- Working with both structured and spatial datasets
